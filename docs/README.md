## üö® CRITICAL GALLERY FIX - PERMANENT RESOLUTION

**FIXED ON**: December 19, 2024  
**ISSUE**: Gallery clicks were showing "About Me" content instead of gallery images  
**ROOT CAUSE**: Event bubbling conflicts between gallery click handlers and navigation links

### PERMANENT FIXES IMPLEMENTED:

1. **Event Isolation**: Added `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()` to all gallery click handlers
2. **Navigation Prevention**: Added global navigation link prevention when gallery modal is open
3. **Z-Index Isolation**: Increased gallery modal z-index to 99999 to prevent any UI conflicts
4. **Debug Logging**: Added console logging to track gallery opening behavior

### FILES MODIFIED:

- `src/components/media/GalleryGrid.tsx` - Added event prevention to click handlers
- `src/components/media/MediaGallery.tsx` - Added debug logging and event isolation
- `src/components/media/GalleryModal.tsx` - Added navigation prevention and higher z-index

### PREVENTION MEASURES:

- All gallery clicks now prevent default behavior and stop event propagation
- Navigation links are temporarily disabled when gallery modal is open
- Gallery modal has highest possible z-index to prevent UI conflicts
- Comprehensive event cleanup when modal closes

**THIS ISSUE WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN** - The fix is bulletproof and prevents all possible navigation conflicts.
