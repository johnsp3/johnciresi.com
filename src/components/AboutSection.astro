            I'm a singer, songwriter, guitarist and producer. Although I've worked across many genres throughout my career, rock and hard rock are where I feel most at home. There's something about the raw power of those heavy riffs that keeps pulling me back.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond the music, I paint and sketch. I've designed all my album covers myself, developing a distinctive visual style that runs through my work. For me, the music and artwork aren't separate things—they're different ways of telling the same story. Whether it's the heavy intensity of <span class="text-accent-primary font-medium">"Fractured"</span> or the more introspective moments on <span class="text-accent-primary font-medium">"The Revealing"</span>, each album captures exactly where I was in life at that moment.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've collaborated with many artists over the years, and recently started writing my first ebook, <span class="text-accent-primary font-medium">"The Visual Man."</span> It explores how music and visual art intersect to create something greater than either could achieve alone. That connection between sound and image has always fascinated me—the way words, music, and vision can all feed into each other.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I'm in the studio, I use modern recording techniques. I'm not trying to recreate some vintage sound; I'm just bringing to life what I hear in my head. Each project is its own snapshot in time.
